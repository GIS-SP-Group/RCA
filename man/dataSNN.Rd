\title{Generate cell clusters using hierarchical clustering and dynamic tree cutting.}
\usage{
dataSNN(
  rca.obj,
  k = 10,
  eps = 8,
  minPts = 5,
  dist.fun = "All",
  corMeth = "pearson"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rca.obj}{RCA object.}

\item{k}{Number of cells to consider in the neirest neighbour graph. Default is 10.}

\item{eps}{Number of cells that have to be similar to connect 2 cells in a network. Default is 8}

\item{minPts}{Number of cells with at least eps neighbours to be considered a core point. Default is 5.}

\item{dist.fun}{Either PCA or All. For PCA, a PCA reduction of the projection will be performed before the correlation matrix is computed.}

\item{corMeth}{Correlation method used to compute distance}
}
\value{
RCA object.
